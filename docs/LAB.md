# Lab notebook

Short, dated notes on experiments that live in `lab/`. Each entry says what was tried, the measured numbers,
the machine and model, what it was compared against, and what follows. Lab code is not shipped; nothing here is
a product claim until its answers were checked against a reference engine on the same model.

## Thesis: rows are free

For a model that does not fit in cache, one decode pass is limited by how fast the weights stream from memory,
not by arithmetic. On a Sapphire-Rapids-class CPU with AMX, the int8 multiply-accumulate hardware should be able
to process many activation rows (concurrent requests, speculation positions of one request, or prompt tokens)
in nearly the time of one row, as long as the weights are read once per pass. llama.cpp pays 2.5-3x the time of
one row for 8 rows on this machine, so if a kernel makes extra rows nearly free, throughput under load, prefill
and exact speculation all rise above llama.cpp. ROW1 tests whether that holds on this VM.

## ROW1

Machine for all entries unless stated: 4 vCPU KVM guest, Intel Sapphire-Rapids-class Xeon at 2.1 GHz
(AMX int8/bf16, AVX-512 VNNI), 2 MiB L2 per core, 260 MiB L3, 15 GB RAM, THP in madvise mode. Reference engine:
llama.cpp commit 4227c9b, Release CPU build, Q8_0 GGUFs. Code: `lab/row1/`.
